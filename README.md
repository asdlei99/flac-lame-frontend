# WinLamb More

An addendum to [WinLamb](https://github.com/rodrigocfd/winlamb) library, with native control wrappers, utility classes and extended funcionalities.

WinLamb More already covers many different funcionalities, but it's not entirely complete yet... if by "complete" you understand to cover the whole Win32 API, which is huge. New features can be added at any time, though. If you miss something, you're welcome to contribute.
