# WinLamb

A lightweight modern C++ library for [Win32 API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API), using [C++11 lambdas](https://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-lambda-closures.html) to handle Windows messages.

## 1. Overview

As far as I can remember, around 2002 I started wrapping all my Win32 routines in classes, to make them reusable to myself, to save my time. Through all these years it took the form of a real library, a thin abstraction layer over raw Win32. People who saw it often commented that it was good, so in 2017 I decided to publish it on GitHub.

Then I wrote [CodeProject - WinLamb: using C++11 lambdas to handle Win32 messages](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1184175/WinLamb-using-Cplusplus-lambdas-to-handle-Win-mess), a comprehensive article explaining WinLamb's message handling model, with [dialogs](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/desktop/dlgbox/dialog-boxes) and also [ordinary windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/desktop/winmsg/windows). Actually, features from C++14 and C++17 are used as well, as much as my compiler (Visual C++) allows it.

Beyond dialog/window message handling, WinLamb also has wrappers for most native Windows controls ([textbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/desktop/Controls/edit-controls), [listview](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/desktop/Controls/list-view-control-reference), etc.), along with other utility classes (strings, file I/O, COM wrappers, etc.) which play nice together. These controls and utilities, however, are _not_ mandatory: you can use your own classes upon the basic dialog/window infrastructure.

WinLamb by no means covers the whole Win32 API, simply because it's too huge. It just wraps some things. New features are constantly being added, though.

## 2. Setup

WinLamb is a header-only library. You can clone the repository or simply [download](https://github.com/rodrigocfd/winlamb/archive/master.zip) the files; once referenced in your source code, it should work right away.

It has been tested with Visual C++ 2017.

### 2.1. Windows 10 manifest file

There's an included `win10.exe.manifest` file, which you can [add to your Visual Studio project](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18115255/6923555). This manifest includes Common Controls and gives you [Windows 10 support](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/desktop/SysInfo/targeting-your-application-at-windows-8-1).

## 3. Example

This is a simple Win32 program written with WinLamb. Each window has a class, and messages are handled with C++11 lambdas. There's no need to write a message loop or window registering.

*Declaration:* My_Window.h

````cpp
#include "winlamb/window_main.h"

class My_Window : public wl::window_main {
public:
    My_Window();
};
````

*Implementation:* My_Window.cpp

````cpp
#include "My_Window.h"

RUN(My_Window) // optional, generate WinMain call and instantiate My_Window

My_Window::My_Window()
{
    setup.wndClassEx.lpszClassName = L"SOME_CLASS_NAME"; // class name to be registered
    setup.title = L"This is my window";
    setup.style |= wl::ws::MINIMIZEBOX;

    on_message(WM_CREATE, [this](wl::wm::create p) -> LRESULT
    {
        set_text(L"A new title for the window");
        return 0;
    });

    on_message(WM_LBUTTONDOWN, [](wl::wm::lbuttondown p) -> LRESULT
    {
        bool isCtrlDown = p.has_ctrl();
        long xPos = p.pos().x;
        return 0;
    });
}
````

### 3.1. Project examples

I've written the following examples showcasing different things:

* [Click lines](https://github.com/rodrigocfd/click-lines)
* [FLAC/LAME frontend](https://github.com/rodrigocfd/flac-lame-frontend)
* [Chromium Peeker](https://github.com/rodrigocfd/chromium-peeker)

## 4. Classes summary

Each file is named after the class it contains; for example, file "button.h" contains `button` class.

To create your windows, you inherit from these classes below. See the [article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1184175/WinLamb-using-Cplusplus-lambdas-to-handle-Win-mess) and the [examples](#3-example) to learn how to use them:

| Class | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`dialog_control`](dialog_control.h) | Inherit from this class to have a dialog to be used as a control within a parent window. |
| [`dialog_main`](dialog_main.h) | Inherit from this class to have a dialog as the main window for your application. |
| [`dialog_modal`](dialog_modal.h) | Inherit from this class to have a modal dialog popup. |
